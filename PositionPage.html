      <h2>CSS/ Positioning</h2>
      <p>When it comes to building layouts and positioning content on a page there are a handful of different techniques to use. Which technique to use largely depends on the content and the goals of the page, as some techniques may be better than others.
      For example, the ability to float elements side by side provides a nice, clean layout that is receptive to the different elements on a page. However, when more strict control is needed, elements may be positioned using other techniques, including relative or absolute positioning.
      Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
      <h3>Block-level Elements</h3>
      A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
      <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
      An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>value</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>static</td>
          <td>Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>absolute</td>
          <td>The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>fixed</td>
          <td>The element is positioned relative to the browser window</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>relative</td>
          <td>The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>sticky</td>
          <td>The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position
          		A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td>initial</td>
           <td>Sets this property to its default value.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>inherit</td>
            <td>	Inherits this property from its parent element.</td>
         </tr>
       </table>

       <h3>make an object stick to top of screen</h3>

       <p>Sticky positioning in CSS lets us build some really neat interactions in very few lines of code. Itâ€™s useful for any time you want a UI element to stick around in view as the user is scrolling, but not become sticky until the element gets to a specific distance from the top/bottom/left/right egde of the scrolling viewport.
          Note: Not supported in IE/Edge 15 or earlier. Supported in Safari from version 6.1 with a -webkit- prefix.
